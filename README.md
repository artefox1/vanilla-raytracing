# Vanilla Shader Raytracing in Minecraft 1.21
Credit to [Godlander](https://github.com/Godlander/raytracing) and d for the concept of passing core values into post shaders. Scroll down below for screenshots.

## Usage
This resource pack requires the *Fabulous!* graphics setting, and View Bobbing turned off in order to work properly.

The shader uses an `item_display` as a mud block to get the core values. To run the shader at world origin, simply run:
```mcfunction
summon item_display 0.0 0 0.0 {item:{id:"minecraft:mud"}}
```

It's also recommended to set the time to midnight:
```mcfunction
gamerule doDaylightCycle false
time set midnight
```

# Editing files
The core shader transforms the vertices of an item display to cover a small portion of the screen (bottom left corner), then encodes a couple of variables to the texture such as the view matrix and position. Since each fragment has 8-bit RGBA color channels, we can encode one 32-bit float per pixel. Then, the post shader decodes the buffer and passes it to the fragment post shader to do the raytracing.
## Core shaders
All of the core shaders are located in `shaders/core`.
### Fragment shader
Encoding the variables to colors is done in `core/rendertype_entity_cutout.fsh`.

To encode your own data, you can use the included `plot()` function. If your data is in the vertex shader, you can pass it in using the `in` and `out` qualifiers. Note that this function does not return a value, and you must input the color you want to edit. Here is an example:
```glsl
in vec4 data;
plot(vec2(0.0, 1.0), data.x, col); // encode data.x to (0, 1) on the screen
plot(vec2(1.0, 1.0), data.y, col); // encode data.y to (1, 1) on the screen
plot(vec2(2.0, 1.0), data.z, col); // encode data.z to (2, 1) on the screen
plot(vec2(3.0, 1.0), data.w, col); // encode data.w to (3, 1) on the screen
```

## Post shaders
The post shaders are located in `shaders/program`.
### Vertex shader
The code for decoding color data is in `program/render.vsh`. To decode data, use the `dec()` function. Unlike the encoding function in core, this function **does** return a value. Note that texture coordinates here use `ivec2` instead of `vec2`. Hereâ€™s how it works:
```glsl
out vec4 data;
data.x = dec(ivec2(0, 1)); // decode (0, 1) to data.x
data.y = dec(ivec2(1, 1)); // decode (1, 1) to data.y
data.z = dec(ivec2(2, 1)); // decode (2, 1) to data.z
data.w = dec(ivec2(3, 1)); // decode (3, 1) to data.w
```
